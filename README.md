# [TF2] Improved Match Timer
 5CP round win limit gets reduced to the current highest score +1 when the match timer runs out.  For example, if the score is 1 - 2 when the map timer runs out, the win limit will be set to 3 and round continues.
 
# Why Use This Plugin?
 All current competitive rulesets for the 5CP gametype include a timer that sets a hard time limit on matches. Match timers reduce competitive integrity in the 5CP gametype. In its current form, the timer kills comebacks, causes anticlimactic endings, and encourages teams to run down the clock.

 Improved Match Timer reduces the length of matches without encouraging timer related strategies. It allows for exciting comebacks, makes every match end in a last capture, and discourages running down the clock.

# How to Install
